# YOLO_example
a demo of YOLO Ultralytics

I couldn't fit the videos I used for training on github but I was able to add my model.

You can add your own video to videos and test the the model on your video by running predict_vid.py.
Just change the filename in predict_vid.py to the name of the file you add to videos.
